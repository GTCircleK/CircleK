					<h3 class="major">General Overview</h3>
					<p>Circle K is the largest collegiate service organization in the world and is part of the Kiwanis
						family, which includes Key Club (high school), Builders Club (middle school), K-Kids
						(e​lementary school), and other club branches. Our three tenets are service, leadership, and
						fellowship.</p>

					<p>Club members participate in weekly service projects around the Atlanta area and in district
						events in which they meet Circle K'ers from other schools. We keep members involved with service
						projects, but we do not have a minimum requirement of service hours, which allows members to
						volunteer according to their individual schedules. There are numerous leadership opportunities,
						including committee chairs, club officers, and officers on the district and international level.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major">​Georgia Tech Circle K</h3>
					<p> As the Georgia Tech branch of Georgia's Metro Division of Circle K International, GT Circle K
						works with volunteer projects around the city of Atlanta and beyond. Some of our service
						partners include the Atlanta Community Food Bank, Project Open Hand, and Trees Atlanta. In
						addition, we hold fundraisers to benefit various charitable causes, including UNICEF's Six Cents
						Initiative and Relay for Life. We also plan fun social events for the club to enjoy. Circle K
						offers leadership opportunities on the club, district, and international levels, as well as
						scholarships for outstanding student volunteers.</p>
